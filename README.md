## Briefly about the project

This application is just a little practice, nothing more. But it could be interesting for my prospective employer because I used **Styled Components** and **Modal** in this project. Last, but not least I tried to keep the principles of REACT like uni-directional dataflow, state-lifting, and so on...

## Config & Install
